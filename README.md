- 👋 Hi, I’m @tay-lo
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development, ultimately trending toward game development in some capacity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop and package a Chrome Extension to enable HTML Elements on Letterboxd.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of projects. I'd like to work on a portfolio website next before diving into application development.
- 📫 Hmu at taylorjcoghlan@gmail.com if you've got something you'd like to build!
