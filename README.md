- 👋 Hi, I’m @tay-lo
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development, ultimately trending toward game development in some capacity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning website design using SASS/Bootstrap 5.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of projects. After finishing up a portfolio website I'd like to start looking into app development.
- 📫 Hmu at taylorjcoghlan@gmail.com if you've got something you'd like to build!
